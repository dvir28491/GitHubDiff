INFO: 
This is just an simple - but working - "Google Contextual Gadget".
It *extends Gmail* to allow fetching GitHub diff's if an apropriate link is found.
You might think of it as an "Proof of Concept" - as it's clearly just a quick hack to get it done in one night ;-)

HOW TO INSTALL:
It can be installed by your own into gmail, if you're running on Google Apps - 
just by creating an new Application on the Market and then adding it to your Account.

If you'd like me to polish and publish this to the Google Enterprise Market -
you'd have to fund me the publish fee, 100$... ;-)
