GitHubDiff
==========
This gadget will react if an link to a commit is found, it will then use the Github API to fetch the commit and colorize the diff. All this without ever going out of your inbox.

General information 
-------------------
This is just an simple - but working - "**Google Contextual Gadget**".
It **extends Gmail** to allow fetching GitHub diff's if an apropriate link is found.
You might think of it as an "Proof of Concept" - as it's clearly just a quick hack to get it done in one night ;-)

How to install
---------------
It can be installed by your own into gmail, if you're running on Google Apps - 
just by creating an new Application on the Market and then adding it to your Account.

If you'd like me to polish and publish this to the Google Enterprise Market -
you'd have to fund me the publish fee, 100$... ;-)
